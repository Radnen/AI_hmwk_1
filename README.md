AI_hmwk_1
=========

My code for an AI course at PSU. This is basically a local searcher that uses restarts + randomization in order to find a
good solution to an AI problem. It's not perfect in fact it's flawed in any case, but at least it shows how a heuristic
can be used to make a better search for the solution of a problem.

The heuristic is admissable. The results optimistic. :)
